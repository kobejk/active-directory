# Active Directory Home Lab

An Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment inside of VMware Workstation Pro 17.
This project starts with a Windows Server 2022 VM in which things such as basic Users, Groups, and Organisational Units (OU) are configured.

The completed project then moves on to set up a client machine and uses PowerShell scripting to configure over 1000 users.
