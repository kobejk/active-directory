# Active Directory Home Lab

An Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment inside of VMware Workstation Pro 17.
This project starts with a Windows Server 2022 VM in which things such as basic Users, Groups and Organisational units (OU) are configured.
It then moves on to setup a client machine alongside the server and uses a powershell script to configure over 1000 users.

I plan to also make this into a security exercise, where I will exploit the configuration and then mitigate these exploits by providing patches.
